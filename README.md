- The dataset used includes information on loan amounts, interest rates, borrower details, loan status, etc.


## Conclusions
- Borrower credit scores are a significant factor in loan performance.
- Higher interest rates are associated with higher default rates.
- Income levels of borrowers impact their ability to repay loans.
- Certain loan purposes have higher default rates compared to others.
